Constructors:
1)It is a special block of code/similar to a method that is executed when we create an object
of a class
2) The purpose of constructors is to initialize our fields.(if you dont want it to be maged by default
3) They must have the same name as the name of the class
4) Constructors do not have return types not even void
5) we can pass arguments to our constructors just like we do for our methods
SIMILARITIES between CONSTRUCTORS and METHODS
1)Both can have parameters
2)both can have access modifiers like private public and protected/default
Differences constructors and methods:
1) As we can use any name for our method we can not use any name for our constructor
they must have the same name as of our class
2)Constructors can not return values as methods can
3) Constructors are automatically called when an instance of the class is created.
When should use constructors?
when we wan to control the initialization fo our fields.

If  we create our own constructors, compiler(java) will not create automatic
(default) constructors. It will think that if you created one yourself;
 so that is not my job to create a default constructors with no arguments
 if we cretaed even Single constructor, Java will not take responsibilies for creating constructors
 but if we dont create any constructor , Java will create it itself as a default(invisible) one


if we executing the code within the same class - its no matter which access modifier we will be using
with our constructor( public, private,default)- all the varibles will be available

But if we execute our code in a differnet class , we can not access the varibles,
that was stored in private constuctor in another class

Constractors can be also private public

But constructors can not be static; because all the objects in our constructors will be
having the same values; and it make no sense
static -- its when we need to use one value for various plenty of times
(like String nameOfSchool="syntax" --- 100 students will have the same value for school = Syntax

Note: Static fields are initialized in the memory before the object is created


 // why we have to create static variables if we have static void ??
    //first of all it will five an error
    // static method or objects they belong to the class and they only have a single value or a single copie
    // if you have create static method you should create static objects; othervise will not make sense


     // for costructors no need to specify data type(int,double,String and so on)
        // because they dont return anything or print anything like void

  Constractor class{
  Constructors constructors1= new Constructors();

  //constructors.print();
          // Constructors-- name of the class
          // constructors - name of the variable
          // = - assignment
          // new - by specifying "new" we tell to Java that we want an Object
          //Constructors() - those pair of () is called constructore; its purporse to initialize our fields
          // initializing number= 0; name= null; automaticaally
