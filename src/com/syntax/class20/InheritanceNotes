If we have some properties or methods in a class we can utilize these members in another class
without rewriting them again.

We can only inherit from a single class

Class parent with its own code

Class Child extends Parent {

}
class child will inherit all the code from Parent
class + its own code
benefits:
no time consuming,
code reusibility( no need to copy code again and again)
memory saving

disadvantages:
other classes can have all the featheres and codes;
but you can always make it pribate (In Parent) so the child can not acces it
